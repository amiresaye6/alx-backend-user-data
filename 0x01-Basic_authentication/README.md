This project covers the following topics:

- **What authentication means**: 
  Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that entities are who they claim to be, usually by checking credentials such as usernames and passwords.

- **What Base64 is**: 
  Base64 is an encoding scheme used to represent binary data in an ASCII string format. It encodes binary data into a text string using a set of 64 different characters, making it suitable for transmission over text-based protocols.

- **How to encode a string in Base64**: 
  To encode a string in Base64, you can use the following code snippet (in Python):

  ```python
  import base64

  encoded_string = base64.b64encode(b'your_string_here').decode('utf-8')
  print(encoded_string)
  ```

- **What Basic authentication means**: 
  Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. It involves sending a base64-encoded string containing the username and password in the `Authorization` header of an HTTP request.

- **How to send the Authorization header**: 
  To send the `Authorization` header with Basic authentication, you can include it in your HTTP request as shown in the following example (in Python using `requests` library):

  ```python
  import requests
  from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

  response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/endpoint', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('username', 'password'))
  print(response.status_code)
  print(response.text)
  ```
